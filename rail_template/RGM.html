                    Rail Grinding machine is designed to re-profile the rail cross section and to remove or reduce rail 
                    corrugations, corrosion and other railhead surface irregularities. This increases the life of the rail 
                    and the wheel. The rake consists of a control car (CC), four grind cars (GC), a water car (WC), and two 
                    camp cars. This project was done for Indian Railways with collaboration with US company named LORAM.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Front Control Car is provided with pressurized air-conditioned cab with the driving controls and touch 
                     screen consoles known as HMI (Human Machine Interface).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grind Car is equipped with CASNUB 22HS bogie and Cummins QST-30 engine. Two grind carriages and each carriage 
                    is having 12 grinding motors. Water Car the overall capacity of the tank is 70,400 L (18,600 gal.)
                </p>
                <p>
                     Camp Car contain kitchens, dining rooms, lavatories, storage, and potable water tanks. Camp Car2 has a control 
                     room that contains travel console for controlling the machine when traveling with the camp car as the lead car.
