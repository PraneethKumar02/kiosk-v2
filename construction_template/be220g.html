                    The BE220G is powered by a Cummins 6BTAA5.9 direct-injection diesel engine designed for high fuel efficiency, lower emissions, and optimal fuel consumption. Power-shift drive allows smooth shifting with instant speed and directional changes using a single lever. It offers 148 HP @ 2000 rpm, 0.44–1.26 m³ bucket capacity, and 22,800 kg operating mass for medium-to-heavy excavation work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Positive control main pump hydraulic system ensures smooth independent or simultaneous equipment functions. Horsepower summation technology makes full use of engine output for faster cycle times and maximum productivity. Advanced control valve with load sensing reduces hydraulic loss and delivers oil flow proportional to joystick operation for precise control.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Optimized spool gallery enables higher productivity with reduced fuel usage. Intelligent flow distribution and full priority hydraulic functions improve controllability and efficiency. State-of-the-art electronic control enhances flexibility, faster response, and operator comfort.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ergonomically designed cabin offers ample workspace and excellent visibility for safe operations. The centralized monitoring system helps quick checks and alerts operators of abnormalities. Reinforced work attachments with casting design and selectable “S” mode for fuel efficiency or “H” mode for heavy-duty tasks enhance machine versatility.
