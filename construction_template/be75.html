                    The BE75 is powered by Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd. 4R 1040 NA & 4R 1040 TC BSIII diesel engines featuring a direct-injection system, available in both naturally aspirated and turbocharged configurations. Power-shift transmission allows smooth power shifting with instant directional changes using a single lever. It offers 41.9 kW (57 HP) @ 2000 rpm with a NA engine or 53.0 kW (71 HP) @ 2200 rpm with a turbo engine, along with 0.3 m³ bucket capacity and an operating mass of 7,500 kg.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hydraulically assisted controls provide light-touch operation of the work equipment. The axial piston pump supports smooth compound movements and stable travel performance. Its rugged closed-center load-sensing hydraulic system delivers high operational efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The direct injection system reduces fuel consumption while ensuring high operational economy. A specially designed cabin provides ample workspace and enhanced visibility. Remote placement of the hydraulic tank keeps the cabin cooler, improving operator comfort and productivity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dual-speed hydrostatic drive with counterbalance valve and automatic parking brake supports smooth and safe operation. Lower travel speed helps during excavation, while higher speed improves mobility over longer distances. The BE75 is built for reliable and efficient performance in versatile construction tasks.
