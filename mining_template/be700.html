                    The BE700 features simple and feather-touch work-equipment controls due to its hydraulically assisted control system. In Backhoe configuration, it delivers 309 kW (415 HP) @ 1800 rpm, 69,500 kg operating mass, and 4.0 m³ bucket capacity. The newly designed operator compartment offers ample workspace and excellent visibility.
                </p>


                <p>
                    In Loading Shovel / Face Shovel configuration, it provides 309 kW (415 HP) @ 1800 rpm, 70,000 kg operating mass, and 4.5 m³ standard bucket capacity. The BEML BSA6D140-1 diesel engine uses a direct injection combustion system for improved fuel economy. The machine is engineered as a fuel-efficient choice for heavy operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Three operating modes support different duty cycles: Electronic Standard and Medium-Duty modes (S & L) for high excavation efficiency and Manual mode (M) for light-duty work. The swing holding brake provides smooth lifting on inclines. Wide working range and a large undercarriage assure stable operation for maximum working performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The three-pump hydraulic system with independently controlled axial piston pumps ensures smooth compound movements and shorter cycle times. Positive control closed-loop hydraulics reduce losses and increase efficiency. Centralized monitoring in the cabin allows quick checks and alerts to abnormalities, enhancing reliability and service access.
