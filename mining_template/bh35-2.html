                <p>
                    The BH35-2 dump truck is powered by a high-power engine paired with a rugged Allison 4500 ORS electronic shift transmission and a heavy-duty planetary axle. The automatic lock-up clutch ensures strong tractive effort and smooth power delivery. A high power-to-weight ratio provides ample reserve power. This results in faster cycle times and efficient hauling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    With a 31,752 kg maximum payload and a 22.5 m³ heaped body capacity, the truck supports high productivity in mining and quarry operations. The wide target area, large volumetric body and low loading height enable faster and easier loading. Brake systems include adjustment-free wet multiple disc brakes at the rear and dry caliper disc brakes in the front for longer life.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The cabin is spacious, human-engineered and ergonomically designed, offering maximum comfort for the operator. Controls are well-positioned to ensure smooth operation and reduced fatigue over long working hours. Safety features include an integral ROPS cabin, emergency steering and a dual braking system that meets relevant safety standards.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The BH35-2 has a low maintainability and repairability index evaluated as per SAE-J817A, enabling reduced downtime and easier servicing. Orbitrol full-time power steering with an optimized steering angle, wheelbase and shorter turning radius provides excellent maneuverability. These features together deliver dependable performance and operational ease across tough mining environments.
