                    The BH150E dump truck is powered by a high-performance, electronically controlled Cummins diesel engine combined with a GE AC drive system, ensuring smooth, fuel-efficient operation. With 1875 HP, it delivers a continuously variable torque–speed curve for consistent performance across the operating range, even on steep gradients. The diesel-electric power module has fewer wearing parts, ensuring high reliability and durability.

                </p>

                <p>
                    With a heaped capacity of 82 m³ and a maximum payload of 136 MT, the BH150E is designed for high productivity. Its wide-body design, higher volumetric capacity and low loading height support efficient loading cycles. A high power-to-weight ratio further enhances performance and contributes to longer engine life.

                </p>

                <P>
                    The truck features a spacious, ergonomically designed deluxe cabin with operator and co-operator seating, along with a tiltable telescopic steering column and dashboard-mounted air-conditioning system. Safety is built in through a ROPS cabin, emergency power steering, electrical dynamic retarding and a full hydraulic brake system. Fire-retardant hydraulic hoses (MSHAS compliant), rear-view camera and blind-spot mirrors enhance operational safety.

                
                </P>

                <p>
                    Maintenance is simplified with easy access to service points, ensuring reduced downtime and improved serviceability. Power steering and an optimum turning-circle radius provide excellent maneuverability in mining environments. Overall, the BH150E offers a reliable, efficient and safe hauling solution for heavy-duty mining operations.
