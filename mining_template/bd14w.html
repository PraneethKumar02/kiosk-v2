                <p>
                    The BD14W is powered by the sturdy direct-injection, turbocharged BEML BS6D105-1 diesel engine for sustained power and fuel economy. A neutral starter switch is provided in the circuit to prevent engine starting when the transmission gear lever is not in neutral. The machine delivers 110 kW (148 HP) gross and 94 kW (126 HP) net flywheel power at 2000 rpm. A 2.4 m³ angling and tilting blade and an operating mass of around 15,000 kg ensure dependable dozing capability.

                <p>
                    Articulated power steering allows higher maneuverability and faster cycle times in tight working spaces. Limited slip differential on both front and rear axles ensures positive traction during loading operations. Rear axle oscillation increases machine stability across rough and uneven terrain. Centre point articulation contributes to safer steering control in all conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The structural layout ensures that the rear wheels always track the movement of the front wheels. This improves directional stability and cycle efficiency while working in challenging sites. The machine is designed to deliver greater drawbar pull for strong pushing power. Faster cycle time supports higher production in earthmoving applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The neutral starter switch further enhances operational safety in daily usage. The dozer maintains smooth power and control owing to the proven diesel engine. Traction support systems ensure reliable operation even during demanding ground engagement. Overall, the BD14W ensures a balance of maneuverability, traction and productivity for general dozing tasks.
