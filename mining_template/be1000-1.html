                    The BE1000-1 has a wide working range and large undercarriage that assure stable operation for maximum performance. In Backhoe configuration, it provides 485 kW (650 HP) @ 1800 rpm, an operating mass of 105,000–108,000 kg, and bucket capacity of 4.5–6.5 m³. The specially designed cab offers excellent workspace and visibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In Face Shovel / Loading Shovel configuration, it has 485 kW (650 HP) power, 108,000–110,000 kg operating mass, and 4.5–7.0 m³ bucket capacity. A three-pump hydraulic system with independent closed loop swing ensures smooth compound movement and shorter cycle times. Hydraulically assisted work-equipment controls provide simple and light-touch operation.

                <p>
                    The Cummins diesel engine includes a modular common-rail system for reduced fuel consumption and high operational economy. A turbocharger supports strong performance even at high altitude job sites. The undercarriage design ensures stable performance during heavy digging and loading.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Centralized monitoring systems in the cab allow fast daily checks and constant abnormality alerts. Automatic lubrication minimizes failures by supplying grease to critical hinge pins and swing circle bearings. The automatic fire detection and suppression system prevents fire accidents and protects valuable resources.
