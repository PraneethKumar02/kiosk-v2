                    The machine has a wide working range and a large undercarriage that assure stable operation for maximum working performance. In BACKHOE configuration, it offers Gross Horsepower: 2 × 300 kW @ 1500 rpm, an Operating Mass of 1,75,000 kg, and Bucket Capacity: 10–12 m³. In LOADING SHOVEL configuration, it has the same power and operating mass, with Bucket Capacity: 7.5–10.2 m³. The specially designed cab provides plenty of workspace and excellent visibility for the operator.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The four-pump hydraulic system with independent closed-loop swing function ensures smooth compound movements of the equipment and travel. This contributes to shorter cycle time and efficient operation in tough working conditions. TEFV squirrel-cage induction motors rated 2 × 6.6 kV, 4-pole, 3-phase, 50 Hz deliver 2 × 300 kW for high operational economy. Work equipment controls are simple and light-touch due to hydraulically assisted actuation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Centralized monitoring systems in the cab allow fast daily checks and keep the operator constantly informed of any abnormality during operation. Automatic lubrication supplies optimum grease to vital hinge pins and swing circle bearings, reducing failures and downtime. The automatic fire detection and suppression system prevents fire accidents and protects valuable resources. This machine is designed for safe, efficient, and long-term production environments.
