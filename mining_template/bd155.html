                The BD155 dozer is powered by the environmentally friendly BS6D170-1 engine that ensures low vibration, smoke and noise during operation. Its power-shift single-lever transmission and pilot-operated hydraulics provide smooth control and responsive performance. A rugged undercarriage with high-tensile frames and advanced sealing enhances durability and reduces maintenance needs. The ROPS-FOPS cabin with armchair steering and anti-vibration mounting ensures safety, comfort and stability in tough working environments.

                <p>
                    The BD155 is powered by the BEML BS6D170-1 engine, designed to be environment-friendly with reduced vibration, noise, and smoke. The power-shift transmission provides smooth and responsive gear shifts with a single-lever control for instant speed and directional changes. It delivers strong pushing performance with its operating mass of 38,000 kg and 242 kW (324 HP) flywheel power. Armchair steering control and a ROPS-FOPS hexagonal sound-suppressive cabin enhance comfort and operator safety
                </p>

                <p>
                   The pilot-operated hydraulic system enables effortless and fine blade control through the joystick. Hydraulically interlinked steering clutch and brakes offer excellent maneuverability during gradual and pivot turns. The patented engine speed control mechanism through braking ensures better machine control. It also helps reduce brake band wear and prevents oil contamination.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Track-roller frames are built using high-tensile steel for maximum rigidity and durability. Steel blades with different configurations are available to suit various ground conditions and applications. The sturdy attachment design withstands adverse working surfaces and heavy dozing loads. Bolt-on type segmented sprockets allow quick on-site replacement when required.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Special grooved floating seals and unique dust seals extend undercarriage component life by keeping dirt out and lubrication inside. The radiator, fuel tank, floor frame, engine and cabin are mounted on anti-vibration rubber cushions to isolate vibration. This helps reduce overall noise levels and improve comfort during long operations. Low maintenance requirements contribute to reduced operational costs and improved machine uptime.
