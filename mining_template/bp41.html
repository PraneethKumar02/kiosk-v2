                <p>
                    The BP41 is powered by a BEML BS6D125-1 diesel engine, delivering sustained power and fuel economy with a hydraulically actuated oil-cooled main clutch. It comes with a heavy-duty constant-mesh transmission using helical gears for reliable performance. It delivers 134 kW (180 HP) @ 1850 rpm with an operating mass of 29,870 kg for pipe-laying applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Maximum lifting capacity is supported as per the lifting performance curve to handle a wide range of pipes with joystick control. The boom is a welded box-section operated by wire cables, and track-roller frames are made from high-tensile steel for rigidity. Part commonality with the BEML BD80 model ensures easy servicing and proven reliability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hydraulically actuated, self-adjusting oil-cooled steering clutches ensure long service life. Steering brakes are also oil-cooled for better durability. Counterweights are hydraulically actuated to provide increased stability during pipe handling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Faster operation is supported with two speeds for raising and lowering operations. The automatic boom kick-out device enhances efficiency and safety in field operations. The BP41 is engineered for productivity and reliable pipe-laying in rugged conditions.
