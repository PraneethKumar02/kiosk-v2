                    The BD30W-1 is powered by the sturdy, direct-injection turbocharged BEML BS6D140-1 EG electronically controlled diesel engine, delivering sustained power and fuel economy. It uses a power-shift transmission with a suitable torque converter offering 4 forward and 3 reverse speeds for versatility in various terrains. A heavy-duty planetary axle ensures high tractive effort and gradeability across operating conditions. The electronic display and monitoring system helps prevent minor problems from becoming major failures.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A flywheel power of 224 kW (300 HP) and operating mass of 30,000 kg support strong dozing capacity and overall productivity. The 4.7 m² blade capacity ensures efficient material handling. Attention-free wet multiple disc brakes for the front and rear axles enhance reliability and stopping power. The box-type chassis construction ensures uniform stress distribution during heavy operations.

                <p>
                    Durability is reinforced through reliable cutting edges, end bits, pins and bushings designed for extended life. Articulated power steering provides an optimum blend of travel speed, turning radius and wheelbase for excellent maneuverability. The EMS helps monitor equipment health continuously. Its advanced warning alerts ensure early detection and prevention of breakdowns.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A roomy walk-through cab enhances comfort and ease of movement for the operator. Ergonomically arranged manually operated control levers support smooth forward and reverse driving selections. A cushioned, adjustable suspension seat with excellent visibility helps in accurate dozing and leveling. The FRP dashboard houses all operator controls, switchgear and warning displays with improved ergonomics and comfort.
