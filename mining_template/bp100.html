                <p>
                   The BP100 is powered by a BS6D170-1 BEML turbocharged engine that ensures superb fuel economy and a high HP-to-weight ratio for a wide range of pipe-laying work. Smooth and responsive power-shift transmission features a single-lever control for instant speed and directional changes. It provides 310 kW (416 HP) @ 2000 rpm and an operating mass of 62,000 kg for demanding lifting tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The boom is a welded box-section design operated by wire cables, ensuring strong lifting capability. Track-roller frames are made of high-tensile steel for maximum rigidity. Bolt-on segmented sprockets allow quick on-site replacement without track removal.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Pilot-operated hydraulics enable effortless joystick control of the hook, boom, and counterweight. Hydraulically interlinked steering with clutch-and-brake control provides excellent maneuverability during gradual and sharp turns. Conveniently located armchair steering enhances operator comfort and control.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two-speed compact planetary hydraulic winches enable smooth raising and lowering of work attachments. Both winches are mounted on the right-hand side of the equipment for better visibility. Features including emergency hook lowering and automatic boom kick-out enhance safe operation and efficiency.
