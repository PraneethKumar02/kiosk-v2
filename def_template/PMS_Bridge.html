                    The Pontoon Bridge Set is a floating bridge system designed for transporting military vehicles 
                    across water obstacles and marshy terrain.
                <p>
                     It consists of various members like:<br>- MID Stream Pontoon <br>- Shore Pontoon
                     <br>- Pavement Laying Truck<br>- Truck Mounted Crane<br>- Dolly<br>- Boat
                </p>
                <p>
                    Midstream, Shore and Road laying members are loaded on separate vehicles thereby allowing for 
                    easy transportation of the equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                     The midstream members are joined together to form the floating bridge.
                    Shore members are connected to the midstream members & serves as the transition section between the floating part and the bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The bulldozer attachment fitted on the Road-Laying truck is used for preparing approach roads, removal of obstacles etc.
                    The truck mounted crane is used for loading/unloading of various members at launching site
