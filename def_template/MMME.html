                <p>
                    MMME Mk-II is developed on BEML 6x6 prime mover, designed for speedy marking/fencing of mine fields with minimal human intervention.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Marking/fencing is carried out with the help of Lang Angle Iron Pickets (LAIPs) and rope.The pickets are placed 
                     mechanically with the help of this equipment at an interval of 10/15 meters and then rope is tied at two locations on to the picket thus making a fence around the minefield.
                </p>
                <p>
                    MMME Mk-II is a semi-automated system wherein handling of picket & tying of rope on to the picket is done manually however the most arduous task of hammering the picket 
                    into the ground up to the desired depth is done mechanically with built in automation.
                </p>
                <p>
                     The system is designed to operate in plains, as well as semi-desert & desert, in all weather conditions. The equipment also records the details of fencing 
                      operation like picket number, burying depth and inter-picket spacing etc.
